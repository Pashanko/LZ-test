(“Lowcost”), a subsidiary of Lowcosttravelgroup Limited. It was an all-inclusive package holiday at the Summer Sun and Beach Hotel in Bodrum, Turkey, and included flights, accommodation, airport parking and transfers. </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">2.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">Lowcost did not own or operate the hotel but booked it through a third party known as LTS, which operated as an intermediary between Lowcost and the hotel.

They had arranged travel insurance with ‘Top Dog’ insurance. On <span style='background-color:red;'>13 May 2014</span> they had their evening meal at the hotel restaurant, which was at first floor level. In order to return to their hotel room, they had to walk down a flight of steps.  Mrs Miller fell and broke her left leg badly, suffering an open fracture. She claims that her accident was attributable to the hotel’s breach of local standards, and that in consequence Lowcost was in breach of contract. That is not an issue for determination at this stage, however.</p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">4.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">Mrs Miller went with her husband to hospital in an ambulance.

Through their travel insurer, Mr and Mrs Miller arranged an alternative flight to take them home on <span style='background-color:red;'>15 May 2014</span>. She went to the James Cook Hospital in Middlesbrough, which assessed her and put her in for an x-ray on <span style='background-color:red;'>19 May 2014</span>, a Monday, but her condition had deteriorated over the weekend and on <span style='background-color:red;'>19 May 2014</span> she was kept in hospital. While she was there, she saw a television advertisement for the defendant’s Legal Helpline and she called it on <span style='background-color:red;'>19 May 2014</span>, leaving a message and asking for a call back. The same day Ms Victoria Halliwell called her back. Ms Halliwell was a Legal Helpline advisor. She told Mrs Miller that she was referring the matter to the defendant’s Travel Legal Group. </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">5.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">Ms Halliwell then referred the matter to Ms Victoria Pegg at the defendant’s International Travel Litigation Group (“ITLG”), and on <span style='background-color:red;'>20 May 2014</span> Ms Pegg left Mrs Miller a voicemail message, and sent her a letter.  </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">6.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">Mrs Miller suffered a chronic infection in her injured leg requiring regular attendance at hospital, and she underwent a number of further operations and admissions to hospital. Her son-in-law, Darren Holt, had some contact with the defendant in the meantime. Unfortunately, Mrs Miller developed serious complications, as a result of which in November 2015 her leg was amputated above the knee. Her claim was therefore passed on to a team dealing with higher value claims and by January 2016 the matter had been transferred to Lesley Edwards in the defendant’s multitrack team. On <span style='background-color:red;'>25 January 2016</span> Ms Edwards sent Mrs Miller the conditional fee agreement that the defendant was willing to enter into with her. On <span style='background-color:red;'>22 February 2016</span> Ms Edwards sent a letter of claim to Lowcost containing the following passage.</p>          <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div>              <p class="judgment-body__text">“Please confirm the identity of your insurers.

On <span style='background-color:red;'>8 March 2016</span> HCC wrote to the defendant reserving its position pending further information. On <span style='background-color:red;'>11 March 2016</span> Plexus Law wrote to the defendant on behalf of Lowcost asking among other things whether Mrs Miller had reported her accident to Lowcost at the time.  She said she had not, and on <span style='background-color:red;'>13 April 2016</span> Ms Edwards emailed Plexus to say so. On <span style='background-color:red;'>28 April 2016</span> HCC wrote to Lowcost declining to indemnify it in respect of claims arising from the incident on the ground that although Lowcost had been formally notified of the claimant’s accident by LTS on <span style='background-color:red;'>15 May 2014</span>, Lowcost had failed to notify HCC of it until March 2016 (a delay of nearly 2 years), so that Lowcost was in breach of General Condition 7 of its insurance policy, which was a condition precedent to its insurance. On <span style='background-color:red;'>21 July 2016</span> Plexus informed the defendant that cover had been declined, and added for good measure that Lowcost had gone into administration.  The defendant instructed counsel, who advised that HCC was entitled to decline cover.  The defendant agrees with that. On <span style='background-color:red;'>7 March 2017</span> the defendant wrote to Mrs Miller stating that due to the decision of HCC and the administration of Lowcost “there is no viable source of compensation for your claim and we will be unable to proceed with it”. On <span style='background-color:red;'>28 April 2017</span> the defendant wrote to Mrs Miller confirming that it was closing its file.  Unable to prosecute her claim against Lowcost, Mrs Miller now seeks a remedy against the defendant in these proceedings.</p>          </div></section>        <section>            <p><b><u>Summary of issues</u></b></p>          </section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">8.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">The claimant’s case against the defendant is in summary that in breach of duty to her the defendant failed to advise her to notify Lowcost of her claim or the circumstances giving rise to it, and itself failed to notify Lowcost of those matters; that if it had done so, then shortly after <span style='background-color:red;'>19 May 2014</span> Mrs Miller would have written to Lowcost to do so or instructed the defendant to do so on her behalf; and if that had been done, Lowcost would have notified HCC, and HCC would have indemnified Lowcost for its liability to the claimant; but that because it was not done, Mrs Miller lost the opportunity to recover compensation for her injury.

It denies that even if Lowcost had been notified, it would have notified HCC; and  alleges that even if Lowcost had notified HCC, the insurance policy had an annual aggregate deductible of £560,000 of which only £8000 had been paid at the time of Lowcost’s administration, so that no payment could have been made.</p>          </div></section>        <section>            <p><b><u>Preliminary issues for determination</u></b></p>          </section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">10.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">The matter was listed before me for 3 days before the trial of the following preliminary issues.</p>          <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">i)</span><div>              <p class="judgment-body__text">Whether, and if so the date on which, a contract of retainer between the claimant and the defendant was formed or a like duty assumed</p>            </div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">ii)</span><div>              <p class="judgment-body__text">if such a retainer was formed or a like duty assumed, the terms and scope of the retainer between the claimant and defendant at the point it was formed and, if relevant, the point at which the scope of the retainer changed</p>            </div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">iii)</span><div>              <p class="judgment-body__text">if such a retainer was formed or like duty assumed, whether the defendant had an obligation to take steps to notify Lowcost and/or advise the claimant to notify Lowcost of the claimant’s accident</p>            <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">a)</span><div>                <p class="judgment-body__text">during the initial call between the claimant and the defendant on <span style='background-color:red;'>19 May 2014</span>;

This was agreed to be the email address of the local representative of LTS, and I take it that the email was the result of communication between the hotel manager and LTS.  It was assigned high importance. The email read “Guest’s leg was broken so they have to stay in hotel longer, normally their c/out is today. Please could you call them and send me their extension ASAP”. The response, at 12:44 was as follows, “we’ve have [sic] spoken to guest and will be travelling back today as normal. As the guest has informed me that the accident happened in hotel restaurant, I will need a full report from hotel when and how it happened.

As the evidence made clear when the letter of claim was served, it was not the practice of the defendant to require that information until that stage; and how rapidly one reached that stage, if at all, would depend upon the provision of information, and the conduct of conflict checks which had not yet been provided or undertaken. </p>          </div></section>        <section>            <p><u>Follow up: <span style='background-color:red;'>7 July 2014</span></u></p>          </section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">30.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">On <span style='background-color:red;'>7 July 2014</span> Ms Pegg wrote to Mrs Miller again to ask for the documents as soon as possible.

The delay was not attributable to any indecision on her part whether to use the defendant’s services.

I accept that evidence. It is inherently plausible. There is a substantial difference between being told that it is urgent to contact Lowcost and/or its insurers to preserve insurance cover in order to protect payment of claim (which is more or less the opposite of what she was actually told later, which was that it did not matter), and being asked for documentation in order to get the process going, when she was in and out of hospital, as I accept she was, (and as the file note dated <span style='background-color:red;'>5 August 2014</span> records Darren as having told Ms Pegg).</p>            </div></section></div></section>        <section>            <p><u>Timesheets</u></p>          </section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">32.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">At this point, it is relevant to consider the defendant’s timesheets, which for present purposes have been printed from its electronic systems.

The timesheets record, among other things, chargeable work done, the fee earner, and the amount chargeable. In Mrs Miller’s case they date back to well before the date upon which she entered into the conditional fee agreement.  There is no suggestion that any of these charges were billed at the time, and I take it that they were not. Nor could there be any suggestion that the defendant could have billed Mrs Miller for any of this time at the time: no agreement about fees had been made between them, and there might never be any such agreement.  </p>          </div></section>        <section>            <p><u>Conversation with the claimant’s son-in-law: <span style='background-color:red;'>5 August 2014</span></u></p>          </section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">33.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">By a further file note typed on <span style='background-color:red;'>5 August 2014</span> under the same reference, Ms Pegg recorded missing, and returning, a telephone call from Mrs Miller’s son (actually, her son-in-law) Mr Darren (not Kevin) Holt.

Certainly, nothing the defendant had said had indicated that there was urgency.  Mrs Miller’s evidence was, and I accept, that she herself was not dealing with the paperwork, but she was unwell, and concentrating on that.

However, in order to proceed they still needed to establish funding for her claim.  Ms Pegg had reviewed Mrs Miller’s travel insurance but it excluded cover for legal expenses claims against a tour operator. So she asked if there were any other legal expenses insurance. If not, then the defendant was happy to offer her a CFA, the nature of which she explained briefly.

Ms Pegg confirmed that the CFA was only being offered in respect of the claim against Lowcost, but said she would check whether the defendant could assist with the claim for medical negligence.  She did so, but a file note of the same date records that it was considered uneconomic to pursue the medical negligence claim, though there was a hope that any compensation she recovered from the claim against Lowcost would be the same as if she had pursued a medical negligence claim.  In oral evidence, Mrs Miller accepted that she did not now remember this call. Having been able to observe her giving her evidence, I accept that she did not recall it while giving her evidence.  However, her witness statement refers to her remembering it particularly.  I accept that at the time of the statement she did.  In her statement she says that Ms  Pegg said that they did not want to rush things, and that they would not do so in a case which involved only a broken leg, which was when she told her about the amputation. I accept this evidence too though not the sense that Ms Pegg was treating a broken leg as if it did not matter.  From Ms Pegg’s perspective, given that there were ongoing problems, although she did not know about the amputation until she was told, there would have been no particular hurry, subject to limitation.   In her oral evidence Mrs Miller said that both she and Ms Pegg were at fault, and that Ms Pegg had not exactly rushed to look after her. In my judgment that is not a fair assessment: I do not find Ms Pegg to have been at fault since she had made extensive attempts to obtain the documents from Mrs Miller. </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">42.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">Mrs Miller also said in her oral evidence that as far as she was concerned, she was concerned only to make a claim against Lowcost.

As a result of this, he said, it appeared that Mrs Miller’s claim was against an uninsured company now in administration. In fact, it appears that it had gone into administration in July 2016.  Ms Edwards told Mr Banks, of the defendant. His response was to say “let’s proceed as we discussed”, but there is no evidence about that discussion apart from what happened next, which was that Ms Edwards wrote to Mrs Miller following a telephone conversation, to confirm that Lowcost had recently gone into administration and that this was likely to cause a significant issue in terms of the ability to recover any compensation; and that the policy of insurance had been voided due to a failure to notify, which they were checking. (In fact, the policy had not strictly been voided, but had not responded to the claim.).

The ‘operators’ captured data from potential clients to determine if they had a claim and should be referred to the relevant legal team for further investigation, as well as relevant information such as key dates and booking references, so the file can be set up efficiently if the defendant is instructed.

The ITLG helpline helps the defendant’s ITLG to note enquiries with either a low prospect of success for an immediately obvious reason, or a low value claim for which it would be disproportionate to take the instruction. At the start of each call, the operator would open a new file on the IT platform using the Proforma to which I have already referred which, he said, sets out a number of questions to ask the caller in order to capture the information required to assess whether the call should be transferred to the ITLG. </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">75.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">I find that the Proforma goes considerably further than this, and that many of the questions to which it refers are not and are not intended always to be asked by helpline advisers, but are there to capture information if volunteered and to suggest questions if they seem appropriate to be asked in any particular case. They were not questions which the legal advisor was instructed by the defendant to ask. That is plain from the sheer number of questions or areas for enquiry contained on the Proforma. It would not be practical or sensible in every call to ask all of the questions or explore the areas of enquiry set out on the Proforma which related to the particular circumstances of every potential claim.</p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">76.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">His evidence was that if required, for the purpose of explaining why relevant information was being captured, the operator might provide general legal advice at a very high level. Any such ‘advice’ (to which he referred in inverted commas) was generic, preliminary and pre-retainer as part of the sifting process. The operators did not provide any specific legal advice in relation to the caller’s case, and would not opine on whether it was a good case or not. He did accept, under pressure, that if relevant, the operator might offer high level thoughts for consideration if they thought it was for the benefit of the person calling.  I accept this: it was consistent with the training materials and the evidence of Louise Strutt, to which I refer later; and with the record of the initial call of Mrs Miller. In cross examination he said that advice should not be given unless to help the person calling; but he recognised that whatever generic legal advice any operator would give would be received by the caller, and understood and applied, in the context of their claim.</p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">77.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">The tick list at the end of the Proforma makes it clear, if it was not otherwise clear, that the provision of generic preliminary legal advice contemplated was not just to explain why the questions were being asked.

As counsel for the claimant put it in his oral submissions, the defendant was ‘reeling them in’.</p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">78.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">Mr Lloyd’s evidence was that while the questions asked by the operators were driven by those set out in the Proforma, they might also ask further questions; but they would not ask for specific information, nor details such as whether the caller had notified the tour operator of the incident or ensured that the tour operator had notified its insurers of the incident, though it would not be unusual for a caller to volunteer that information. I do not accept this evidence.   As already noted, but as he appeared to have overlooked, the Proforma itself included a question asking if the caller had notified the tour operator of the incident. The questions on the Proforma about complaints to the tour representative, a complaints form or accident report form, were, he thought, information obtained once referral had been made to a legal team, that is, not information to be obtained or which might be obtained, by the helpline operator. I reject this evidence. The questions were there on the form to be available for use and filled in if used by the operator. There was no evidence to distinguish these questions and any other on the Proforma, and no basis for inferring that they were questions not to be asked by the helpline operator, whether or not the Proforma might also be used by the legal team.

I do not accept this: contrary to his description, it was a very simple document, and I doubt it would have helped an operator much in deciding whether to refer the case.

Hence the (later) language of helpline ‘operators’, and the encouragement on paper at least to give only limited, generic and high-level advice, and only when asked, or at least only when it looked as if it might help. But there was an inevitable tension between minimising that risk and communicating to the caller that, in the defendant, they were dealing with people who cared, and people who would give them valuable legal information (or advice) of relevance to their situation and case. The conclusion is inevitable that the defendant also wanted to do that because it was part of the marketing strategy, and a way of attracting potential clients. That was why the operators worked on a system that allowed them to give legal advice to a limited extent. The system was supposed to balance that tension, but it was an essential part of that system to give the operators themselves very considerable discretion (as the evidence disclosed) about how far to go in any given case.  Partly, no doubt, that was because they were legally qualified, and were the people having the telephone call and were best placed to make the judgment; and partly, perhaps (although this question was not asked or answered) because a degree of indeterminacy helped in balancing the tension to which I have referred. </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">83.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">When asked whether any part of the call involved a disclaimer, he said that there was a recorded part at the beginning of any call, but he did not know what it was at the relevant time.

The advisors were expected to ascertain whether a claim was likely to succeed and was proportionate to pursue, by applying the sifting criteria, assessing the jurisdiction of the limitation position, and applying the allocation process to refer, or to close, cases. Advisors taking the initial enquiries were to provide general legal advice and assess the claim in that way.   Ms Halliwell must have thought Mrs Miller’s case met the criteria and fell within the parameters.  Other helpline advisors were trained to ask, additionally, the usual questions that they would normally be expected to ask when handling a personal injury claim.

The advisors were not trained to say that they were not giving any advice, nor trained to say that the caller could not rely on any advice given on the call. They had ‘safe legal advice’ training before they could give general legal advice. The caller would of course expect it to be relevant to their claim. They were not trained to say that the caller might need to take any urgent steps or seek advice from a different lawyer unless perhaps the operator was closing the case or had been told there were other solicitors.

His evidence was that Lowcost was a tour operator/online travel agency which used third party suppliers for hotel accommodation which, in this case, had been booked through LTS, which was an intermediary between the hotel and Lowcost. LTS would have had a local representative. If a customer needed help, they would contact the hotel or LTS in the first instance, and if that did not resolve the issue, would then call the Lowcost in resort assistance telephone number or email. LTS would keep a record and if the incident was serious enough for the tour operator to need involvement, the tour operator might escalate to Mr Mir. This was a value judgment for them to make. It would be relevant whether the incident might have been the fault of the hotel. If LTS thought the event was sufficiently serious and relevant to the hotel, they would send a report to Lowcost which Mr Mir would see, and consider whether Lowcost needed to report to its insurers.  </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">99.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">He did not recall receiving a report about Mrs Miller, and if he had he would have notified Lowcost’s insurers.

It was incidents rather than claims which needed to be notified. HCC would expect a report of the number of incidents in the month, and Lowcost would compile such a report at the end of the month. There might be 5 to 10 incidents per month. If he had not been notified of an incident, for example if the hotel had not reported it to him, but it later came in as a claim, HCC would assess it and if they were not prejudiced and there was an explanation for the delay, they would usually accept the claim. The email dated <span style='background-color:red;'>15 May 2014</span> to Mailbox in Resort would probably have been the inbox for the LTS 24/7 in-resort team. He would expect the in-resort team to have sought a report from the hotel. If the hotel had reported, Mr Mir would have forwarded it on to HCC. If he had learned of an incident and notified HCC, and explained that the hotel had said they would send a report but had not done so, and that he had just found out, and there were photographs of the steps in question, he would not have expected HCC to say that the delay had been a problem in July 2014. If that scenario had occurred in December 2014, HCC would have reserved its position and then there would have been a discussion about the reason for the delay. If the explanation had been accepted, there would then have been a discussion about what prejudice HCC had suffered. If the explanation was that the hotelier had been told to report and had said it would, but had not done so, that would not amount to a good explanation. HCC would expect him or his team to have followed it up, as the incident was relatively serious.

However, the defendant’s advertisement did not amount to an offer to provide legal services.  It was an invitation to the public to call the helpline to see if the defendant could help by providing legal services. It was, at most, an invitation to treat. The question whether the caller would enter into a retainer with the defendant was one for further consideration on both sides, as each will have readily understood. Merely by telephoning, Mrs Miller cannot be regarded as agreeing to enter into a contract with the defendant. Moreover, the supposed offer in the advertisement contained none of the terms which would have been required to govern a contract of retainer. Whether the defendant did or did not decline to act for her during the call, gave her advice, and told her it was passing her case to ITLG, or recorded time charges, is neither here nor there for these purposes, because part of the way in which the claimant put this submission is that the contract was complete when the telephone call was made (or, at least, answered).</p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">105.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text"> The claimant’s case on this included, however, the proposition (presumably as an alternative) that an express retainer was entered into by the end of that telephone call, and on the basis that the defendant did not decline to act for her but gave her advice and told her it was passing her case to ITLG, and started recording time charges.  On that footing, the claimant’s case must be that a bilateral contract of retainer was concluded orally between the parties during the call on <span style='background-color:red;'>19 May 2014</span>.  But again, at no point during the call did anything the defendant said amount to an offer to enter into a retainer, or an assertion that there was one. The record shows that Mrs Miller provided certain information, was advised as to the scope of the Legal Helpline, the law relating to duty, breach and causation in the context of personal injury, and the applicability of the 3 -year limitation period, and that the matter would be referred to ITLG and that she would hear back, which she did.  The defendant did not decline to act for her because her case had passed that stage of the sifting process described by the witnesses, and because there was no question of its acting for her at that stage. Such limited advice as was given to Mrs Miller at that stage was, in my judgment, advice in contemplation of a potential retainer, and not advice referable to one which had come into existence there and then.  Passing the case to the ITLG for someone to get back to Mrs Miller was not an indication that a retainer had been agreed, but that it had not. The fact that time charges had started to be recorded is nothing to the point. No agreement had been made with Mrs Miller that she should be responsible for the defendant’s fees, and I have no doubt that both sides would have been shocked at the suggestion that they had implicitly made one at that point.  At that stage, the fees would not have been Mrs Miller’s responsibility. They might only become her responsibility if a retainer was subsequently entered into on the footing that they would be.</p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">106.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">Another way in which the claimant put its case in argument was that when a retainer was unarguably entered into, upon the creation of the conditional fee agreement, that agreement was retrospective: that is, the parties did not merely agree that fees incurred before that date would now be chargeable, they agreed that (presumably by some form of mutual estoppel) they should be treated as having entered into an express retainer retrospectively as from <span style='background-color:red;'>19 May 2014</span>.

But there is nothing in the conditional fee agreement which either expressly states that it is to have that effect, or from which that consequence must be implied. Even if the conditional fee agreement did involve the parties agreeing that the defendant’s actions or omissions should be judged by standards and criteria applied only retrospectively, there  would still be nothing in it to require the defendant to have taken steps which it should have taken if there had been a retainer, but which it was under no obligation to take if there was not.  It is simply unrealistic to propose that while on or immediately after <span style='background-color:red;'>19 May 2014</span> the defendant was under no obligation to advise Mrs Miller to notify Lowcost or do it themselves (with her authority) but that it later agreed to take on an obligation to have already done something which it had not done.  No doubt contracts may be made which have that effect but, in my view, they would require clear words to that effect, which are lacking in the present case.</p>          </div></section>        <section>            <p><u>Implied retainer</u></p>          </section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">108.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">I turn, therefore, to the claimant’s case that if there was not an express retainer on <span style='background-color:red;'>19 May 2014</span>, one should be implied.  <span style="color:#000000">The editors of Jackson &amp; Powell on </span><i><span style="color:#000000">Professional Liability</span></i><span style="color:#000000"> (8th ed.) state as follows (at 11-005): </span></p>          <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div>              <p class="judgment-body__text">“In a situation where the parties act as if the relationship of solicitor and client existed, although there is no express agreement to that effect, the court will readily hold that there is an implied retainer to be inferred from the parties’ conduct.” </p>            </div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div>              <p class="judgment-body__text">And in <i>Caliendo v Mishcon De Reya</i> [2016] EWHC 150 (Ch) Arnold J. stated as follows (at para 679): </p>            <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div>                <p class="judgment-body__text">“It is well established, that even if there has been no express retainer, the existence of a retainer may be inferred from the acts of the parties.

It is true that the defendant referred to Mrs Miller from this point onwards as its client; but it did so internally, and did not describe her as its client to her.  Certainly, it opened a file in respect of her enquiry, but again that was an internal matter, and was not communicated to her, and in my judgment would hardly have suggested to any reasonable person in her position that it was a file which related to her as any more than a potential client of the defendant. For the defendant’s own purposes, of course, that is exactly why it needed the file. The defendant recorded time charges against that file, but not on the footing that she was already liable for fees, merely that she might at some time become so.  Again, she was wholly unaware of it at the time.  Had she been asked (and she was not) I very much doubt she would have agreed to be responsible for the defendant’s fees at that point.  The defendant’s system was set up and structured so as to attract enquiries which, after a sifting process, might be converted into a retainer, but only after consideration by ITLG and following the provision by the prospective client of the necessary information and documents.  None of that had occurred on or shortly after <span style='background-color:red;'>19 May 2014</span>. Indeed, on <span style='background-color:red;'>20 May 2014</span> the defendant wrote and asked for documentation saying explicitly that once it had been reviewed, the writer would contact Mrs Miller to discuss whether the defendant was able to accept her case. There was nothing ambiguous about that, and it made it clear that the question whether the defendant was accepting her case remained an open one.  In cross-examination, Mrs Miller said that on the basis of this letter she knew that when Darren sent the defendant the documents which they had asked for, the defendant was taking her case. I accept that she may have thought that, but that is not what the letter said.</p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">110.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">On or about <span style='background-color:red;'>8 April 2015</span>, the defendant finally received and then reviewed Mrs Miller’s accommodation details and invoice for her holiday, following numerous chasing letters <span style="color:#000000">(<span style='background-color:red;'>7 July 2014</span>, <span style='background-color:red;'>22 July 2014</span>, <span style='background-color:red;'>15 August 2014</span>, <span style='background-color:red;'>3 October 2014</span>, <span style='background-color:red;'>2 January 2015</span> and <span style='background-color:red;'>28 January 2015</span>), two of which expressly warned her: </span></p>          <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div>              <p class="judgment-body__text">“You must be aware that no action has been taken by my firm to establish what limitation period would apply to your claim or to protect your right to take any legal action in any jurisdiction”. </p>            </div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div>              <p class="judgment-body__text">Those warnings did not explicitly say, “We are not acting for you” or “We have not yet taken on your case”.

Nor can the mere fact that she was receiving chasing letters have provided her with any such comfort.  The conduct of the defendant is consistent (and in my view actually consistent only) with the defendant’s seeking information with a view to deciding thereafter whether or not to offer to enter into a retainer with Mrs Miller.

I agree that it must have done so then at the latest.  In the period since <span style='background-color:red;'>8 April 2015</span> the defendant had undertaken a number of activities in relation to Mrs Miller’s potential claim.  In May and June 2015, it obtained from the internet Lowcost’s terms and conditions, reviewed them, and sought and obtained counsel’s (free) advice on them.  It did not seek Mrs Miller’s authority to do so; but as the defendant explained to counsel, it had not yet established funding on the matter, and wanted the advice “so we can decide whether we are able to accept the claim”. The purpose of the advice was to determine the basis of any potential claim. That was something in which the defendant had at least as much interest as Mrs Miller, since it was still seeking to determine whether her claim was one which it was prepared to offer to take on as her solicitor. It did not tell her about that advice until September 2015.  </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">112.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">In June and July 2015, the defendant had asked for and obtained Mrs Miller’s travel insurance documents. As it made clear, that was so as to consider how any claim might be funded. Although Mrs Miller said, in effect, that she had not been concerned with how the claim might be funded, the defendant had communicated to her that it was a matter which needed to be resolved before the defendant took on her claim.  The defendant would hardly have done so without being confident of funding.  </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">113.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">On <span style='background-color:red;'>21 September 2015</span> the defendant wrote to Mrs Miller asking if there was any other legal expenses insurance and saying that if not it would be happy to offer her a conditional fee agreement.  The letter asked about the steps: whether there was a handrail, and whether she had any photographs taken at a greater distance showing the surroundings.  Even at this stage, I do not consider that the claimant and the defendant were acting in a way which was only consistent with the defendant having been retained as Mrs Miller’s solicitors.  Funding had still not been resolved. There was no agreement about fees or payment terms. Mrs Miller asked if the defendant could also assist with a clinical negligence claim so, from her perspective at least, the ambit of any potential instructions had not yet been established. None of this is consistent only with the parties having entered into a retainer at that stage.  That did not happen, as the defendant accepts, until <span style='background-color:red;'>25 January 2016</span>, when the defendant told her that it was ready to proceed with her claim, the next step being the completion of the CFA.</p>          </div></section>        <section>            <p><u>A tortious duty of care</u></p>          </section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">114.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">I turn, therefore, to the question whether, in the absence of an express or implied contractual retainer, the defendant owed Mrs Miller an equivalent duty of care in tort at any stage before <span style='background-color:red;'>25 January 2016</span>. </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">115.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">On the basis of, for example, <i>Crossan v Ward Bracewell &amp; Co</i> (1989) 4 P.N. 103 the claimant submits that a duty of care is owed by a solicitor to a prospective client to whom the solicitor gives advice, even if that person is not and never becomes a client of the solicitor. The claimant further submits that even more so, a duty of care will be owed by a solicitor to a prospective client to whom the solicitor gives advice who does actually later become a client of the solicitor. I can deal with that second proposition immediately.  It does not make any difference to the existence of a tortious duty of care to a prospective client whether that client later becomes a client of that solicitor. The duty to the merely prospective client either exists at the time or it does not.  Later events cannot affect that (absent, perhaps, the kind of mutual estoppel to which I have already referred, which is nothing to the point in the present context). </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">116.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">I turn therefore to the first proposition.  In submissions, counsel for the claimant made it clear that although there might be two tests for establishing a relevant tortious duty of care, namely the incremental approach and the assumption of responsibility principle, this was not a case where established present principles do not provide an answer, so that use of the incremental approach was not required.</p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">117.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">The assumption of responsibility principle applies where the parties are in a relationship which gives rise to a responsibility towards those who act upon information or advice and so creates a duty of care towards them. One of the examples of the types of general relationship giving rise to such a duty given by Lord Devlin in <i>Hedley Byrne v Heller</i> [1964] AC 465 was the relationship of solicitor and client.  The ratio of that decision was that the reasonable reliance of Hedley Byrne on the reference, combined with Heller &amp; Partners’ appreciation of the fact that they would reasonably rely on it, give rise to a direct relationship between them involving a duty of care: <i>Playboy Club London Ltd v Banco Nazionale del Lavoro SpA </i>[2018] UKSC 43.  The <i>Playboy </i>case is authority for the proposition that recovery of a purely economic loss in negligence is available where the relationship between the claimant and the defendant made it appropriate; but where there was reasonable reliance by the claimant on the particular representation combined with appreciation by the defendant of that reliance, a direct relationship arose between them involving a duty of care; but it was the responsibility, voluntarily accepted by the defendant, towards those who acted on the representation, based either on a general relationship, or specifically in relation to a particular transaction, which created such a duty.  That approach extends to claims in professional negligence.</p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">118.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">The reference to a voluntary assumption of responsibility must not, however, be taken to mean that the defendant professional needs to consent to the claimant placing responsibility upon him.  Rather it refers to a situation where the doing of that act implies a voluntary undertaking to assume responsibility. Accordingly, in a given case it is the task of the court to consider all the facts and to assess whether they give rise to an implication that the defendant has voluntarily assumed responsibility to the claimant.  In <i>P&amp;P Property Ltd v Owen White &amp; Catlin LLP</i> [2018] 3 WLR 1244 Patten LJ stated at paragraph 76 </p>          <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div>              <p class="judgment-body__text">“… The requirement that there should be an assumption of responsibility is to some extent a legal construct in the sense that in many cases the defendant solicitor or other professional will be treated as having assumed responsibility to the third party for his actions by virtue of the proximity between them and the obvious effect which any failure on his part would have on the third party. There will rarely be an actual, conscious and voluntary assumption of responsibility not least because the solicitor or other professional will have a client to whom he is contractually bound. But, on the basis that the court is deciding whether to treat the defendant as having assumed legal responsibility to the third party, non-client, or his actions, it will be necessary to balance the foreseeability that the third party will rely on the professional to perform their task in a competent manner against any other factors which would make such an imposition of liability unreasonable or unfair.”</p>            </div></section></div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">119.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">The claimant submitted that in the present case, apart from the question of the retainer, the critical question was whether there was the relevant relationship. I agree.  The claimant submitted that there was, because Mrs Miller had sought and received advice, and the defendant was treating her as a client by giving a file reference, with a supervising partner, referring to her as a client, giving her advice as a client, obtaining Counsel’s advice, updating her as a client and so on, and logging fees as work in progress. </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">120.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">I do not accept this.  The true nature of the relationship until was that Mrs Miller was only a potential client of the defendant until <span style='background-color:red;'>25 January 2016</span> and no duty of care equivalent to that under a retainer was owed to her until then.  </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">121.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">The facts upon which the claimant particularly relies do not actually support her case.  I do not accept that the defendant held itself out (via its TV advertisement) as ready, willing and able to assist persons in the position of the claimant: ready and able in principle, yes; but its willingness depended on a sifting process and the creation of a retainer, and its advertisement did not say otherwise.  The limited basis on which the helpline worked was explained to Mrs Miller, as I find.  During her conversation with the claimant on <span style='background-color:red;'>19 May 2014</span>, Ms Halliwell gave Mrs Miller some limited high-level and generic legal advice about personal injury claims, but it did not purport and cannot have been understood to be complete or comprehensive legal advice about her claim, and it was a preliminary to further consideration.  The question of obtaining separate legal advice did not arise for the reasons I have already given.  The fact that during her conversation with Ms Halliwell, Mrs Miller was told that her case was being referred to the defendant’s ITLG counts against there being a general duty in tort equivalent to the solicitor’s duty of care to his client, rather in favour of it.  The defendant’s having a file and matter number for Mrs Miller’s potential claim, recording time charges, and referring to her internally as its client is immaterial for the reasons I have already given.  The fact that the defendant did not want or advise Mrs Miller to seek advice is also immaterial.  The relationship between them was not akin to a contractual relationship.   Mrs Miller was certainly entitled to rely on such advice as she was given, but she was not advised to ensure the insurers were informed, and the facts to which I have referred did not give rise to a duty on the defendant to provide such advice. Her undoubted lack of experience in legal matters does not change that.  </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">122.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text"><i>Crossan v Ward Bracewell &amp; Co</i> (1989) 4 P.N. 103 is to be distinguished.

But if he finds unusual covenants or planning restrictions, it may indeed be his duty to warn of the risks and dangers of buying the house at all, notwithstanding that the client is made up his mind and is not seeking advice about that. I say only that this <i>may</i> be his duty, because the precise scope of that duty will depend <i>inter alia</i> upon the extent to which the client appears to need advice.

The plaintiff defended himself and never instructed the solicitors. The solicitor had, however, failed to tell him that his insurance company would arrange and pay for his legal representation, and since the plaintiff failed to tell his insurers of the proceedings, they repudiated liability; and he had also to meet a third party claim out of his own pocket.

That was a case in which, when solicitors received instructions to act in relation to a notice pursuant to section 25 Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 to terminate a lease, and they were well aware of the applicable time limit, it was held that they were under a duty either to indicate that they were not going to act, or to take immediate steps to ensure that their tenant client’s interests were safeguarded. In the present case, there was no time limit.  But  <i>Whelton Sinclair v Hyland </i>was a case in which the preservation of the tenancy was the central focus of the solicitors’ instructions.  They were not instructed in relation to potential litigation, and what needed to be done was the service of a counter-notice rather than the commencement of a claim.  In the present case, the question is the ambit of instructions to act for a client in a contentious matter.  </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">136.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">Had there been a retainer or a like duty, I should have been inclined to hold that in a contentious claim it included the obligation, at least with an inexperienced client, to consider, or remind the client to consider, whether the proposed defendant was worth powder and shot; and that this might include an obligation at least when notifying the proposed defendant of the potential claim to remind them to notify their insurer. A judgment which cannot be enforced is not worth the expense of pursuit. Prospective defendants, like any other companies, can and do go into liquidation or administration; or their assets may in any event be insufficient to meet the claim without insurance. There was no particular reason to suppose that Lowcost was at any greater risk than any other company of its kind, but equally no particular reason to suppose that it was not at any lower risk. Moreover, I think it unlikely that the Pre-action Protocol for Personal Injury Claims in 2021 represents a new best practice, rather than reflection of an existing standard practice.  I am reinforced in this by the fact that as soon as the letter of claim was sent in the present case, the enquiry about insurance was made. But I do not consider that the duty to make such an enquiry arose before the point at which it was reasonably possible to send a letter of claim or, at the earliest, a prior letter of notification, though any letter of notification would not have been much earlier in the present case, so that here the time for performance of that duty was not, or not significantly, before the letter of claim was actually sent.  Until there was a retainer or like duty, I conclude on the authorities and on the facts of this case that there was no duty to warn in respect of insurance. </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text"><b><u>iii)</u></b><span> </span><b><u>If such a retainer was formed or like duty assumed, whether the defendant had an obligation to take steps to notify Lowcost and/or advise the claimant to notify Lowcost of the claimant’s accident</u></b></p>          <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">a)</span><div>              <p class="judgment-body__text"><b><u>during the initial call between the claimant and the defendant on <span style='background-color:red;'>19 May 2014</span>; or</u></b></p>            </div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">b)</span><div>              <p class="judgment-body__text"><b><u>on or before <span style='background-color:red;'>8 April 2015</span> when the defendant received the claimant’s documents, and if so when; or</u></b></p>            </div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">c)</span><div>              <p class="judgment-body__text"><b><u>before the letter of claim was served on <span style='background-color:red;'>22 February 2016</span>; and if so, when.</u></b></p>            </div></section></div></section>        <section>            <p><u>Conclusion </u></p>          </section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">137.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">I have answered this question in the discussion on the scope of the duty.

The Privy Council held that any award of damages against the solicitors should be made on the accepted basis of the loss of chance of recovery. In reckoning the chances of obtaining payment from the insurer, the correct criterion was to determine the prospects that a reputable insurer would, in the circumstances of the case, have relied on the breach of policy to repudiate liability. The nature of the breach and its effect on the insurer’s ability to handle a claim, were very relevant features. In considering such chances a court should lean, in the event of doubt, in favour of the claimant, since it was the defendant solicitor’s fault which caused the claimant have to litigate on the basis of an imponderable.

The question whether the insurer would have rejected a claim for late notification was one of fact. In that case, the clause was a clear and unequivocal condition precedent regarding early notification, which was a matter of obvious importance to liability insurers’ ability to investigate and assess any claim.

Mr Mir’s evidence, based on his experience, was that HCC expected to be notified within one month and if there had been a delay of more than two or three months, there would have to be a conversation.  I accept this.  He said that if there was a good reason for the delay, there would then have to be a conversation about prejudice; but if there was not a good reason, liability would be repudiated.  On this point, however, I prefer the evidence of the defendant’s insurance expert, Mr McGregor, as being based on wider experience.  His written evidence was that in his experience insurers only consider immediate notice has not been given if the position has been prejudiced by that lack of immediate notice.  There is, as I say, no evidence from HCC on prejudice, but after 11 months, it seems highly likely, as a matter of common sense, that the ability of HCC to investigate the incident was substantially prejudiced, quite apart from the question of late notification.  Although there might be photographs of the stairs in question at the date of the accident, and perhaps maintenance records, witnesses might have moved on, and their recollection would be likely in any event to have been compromised.

Any claims where the total of damages and costs payable fell below £10,000 fell to be met entirely by Lowcost and did not count towards the aggregate access. Only payments over £10,000 would have become part of the aggregate excess of £560,000, and then only to the extent that the claim exceeded the initial retention of £10,000. Only once that aggregate excess of £560,000 was used would the insurer become liable to indemnify against any claim.  The evidence before me shows that only £6765.78 of the aggregate had been eroded for the 2013/2014 policy year: that appears from the letter from Tokio Marine HCC, the successor to HCC.  The way in which this figure is calculated has been provided by the insurers in a spreadsheet.

I accept of course that this case referred to different provisions, and in a different commercial context but there, as here, the words appeared clear, and there seems to be no room for equity to overcome them.  The decision in <i>The Italia Express</i> [1992] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 281 appears to have been directed to a different point, namely the incorporation of the ‘pay to be paid’ provision in the relevant part of an insurance contract.  No such issue arises in the present case. In <i>Teal Assurance Co Ltd v W R Berkely Insurance (Europe) Ltd</i> [2013] UKSC 57 it was held that in the circumstances of that case it was not clear that ‘paid’ meant ‘actually disbursed’; but nor was it clear what actually would have to be disbursed if it did.

I am unable to accept that proposition.  The point was taken in <i>Firma C-Trade SA v Newcastle P &amp; I Association </i>and rejected, on the ground that if the insured could not discharge its liability to a third party and was therefore unable to obtain an indemnity from his P &amp; I club in respect of it, that was not because of any alteration of his rights and his contract of insurance, but because of his inability, by reason of insolvency, to exercise those rights.

On <span style='background-color:red;'>13 May 2014</span> they had their evening meal at the hotel restaurant, which was at first floor level. In order to return to their hotel room, they had to walk down a flight of steps.  Mrs Miller fell and broke her left leg badly, suffering an open fracture. She claims that her accident was attributable to the hotel’s breach of local standards, and that in consequence Lowcost was in breach of contract. That is not an issue for determination at this stage, however.</p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">4.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">Mrs Miller went with her husband to hospital in an ambulance.

Through their travel insurer, Mr and Mrs Miller arranged an alternative flight to take them home on <span style='background-color:red;'>15 May 2014</span>. She went to the James Cook Hospital in Middlesbrough, which assessed her and put her in for an x-ray on <span style='background-color:red;'>19 May 2014</span>, a Monday, but her condition had deteriorated over the weekend and on <span style='background-color:red;'>19 May 2014</span> she was kept in hospital. While she was there, she saw a television advertisement for the defendant’s Legal Helpline and she called it on <span style='background-color:red;'>19 May 2014</span>, leaving a message and asking for a call back. The same day Ms Victoria Halliwell called her back. Ms Halliwell was a Legal Helpline advisor.

Her claim was therefore passed on to a team dealing with higher value claims and by January 2016 the matter had been transferred to Lesley Edwards in the defendant’s multitrack team. On <span style='background-color:red;'>25 January 2016</span> Ms Edwards sent Mrs Miller the conditional fee agreement that the defendant was willing to enter into with her.

She said she had not, and on <span style='background-color:red;'>13 April 2016</span> Ms Edwards emailed Plexus to say so. On <span style='background-color:red;'>28 April 2016</span> HCC wrote to Lowcost declining to indemnify it in respect of claims arising from the incident on the ground that although Lowcost had been formally notified of the claimant’s accident by LTS on <span style='background-color:red;'>15 May 2014</span>, Lowcost had failed to notify HCC of it until March 2016 (a delay of nearly 2 years), so that Lowcost was in breach of General Condition 7 of its insurance policy, which was a condition precedent to its insurance. On <span style='background-color:red;'>21 July 2016</span> Plexus informed the defendant that cover had been declined, and added for good measure that Lowcost had gone into administration.  The defendant instructed counsel, who advised that HCC was entitled to decline cover.  The defendant agrees with that. On <span style='background-color:red;'>7 March 2017</span> the defendant wrote to Mrs Miller stating that due to the decision of HCC and the administration of Lowcost “there is no viable source of compensation for your claim and we will be unable to proceed with it”.

As the evidence made clear when the letter of claim was served, it was not the practice of the defendant to require that information until that stage; and how rapidly one reached that stage, if at all, would depend upon the provision of information, and the conduct of conflict checks which had not yet been provided or undertaken. </p>          </div></section>        <section>            <p><u>Follow up: <span style='background-color:red;'>7 July 2014</span></u></p>          </section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">30.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">On <span style='background-color:red;'>7 July 2014</span> Ms Pegg wrote to Mrs Miller again to ask for the documents as soon as possible.

The delay was not attributable to any indecision on her part whether to use the defendant’s services.

I accept that evidence. It is inherently plausible. There is a substantial difference between being told that it is urgent to contact Lowcost and/or its insurers to preserve insurance cover in order to protect payment of claim (which is more or less the opposite of what she was actually told later, which was that it did not matter), and being asked for documentation in order to get the process going, when she was in and out of hospital, as I accept she was, (and as the file note dated <span style='background-color:red;'>5 August 2014</span> records Darren as having told Ms Pegg).</p>            </div></section></div></section>        <section>            <p><u>Timesheets</u></p>          </section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">32.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">At this point, it is relevant to consider the defendant’s timesheets, which for present purposes have been printed from its electronic systems.

The timesheets record, among other things, chargeable work done, the fee earner, and the amount chargeable. In Mrs Miller’s case they date back to well before the date upon which she entered into the conditional fee agreement.  There is no suggestion that any of these charges were billed at the time, and I take it that they were not. Nor could there be any suggestion that the defendant could have billed Mrs Miller for any of this time at the time: no agreement about fees had been made between them, and there might never be any such agreement.  </p>          </div></section>        <section>            <p><u>Conversation with the claimant’s son-in-law: <span style='background-color:red;'>5 August 2014</span></u></p>          </section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">33.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">By a further file note typed on <span style='background-color:red;'>5 August 2014</span> under the same reference, Ms Pegg recorded missing, and returning, a telephone call from Mrs Miller’s son (actually, her son-in-law) Mr Darren (not Kevin) Holt.

Certainly, nothing the defendant had said had indicated that there was urgency.

However, in order to proceed they still needed to establish funding for her claim.  Ms Pegg had reviewed Mrs Miller’s travel insurance but it excluded cover for legal expenses claims against a tour operator. So she asked if there were any other legal expenses insurance. If not, then the defendant was happy to offer her a CFA, the nature of which she explained briefly. If Mrs Miller was interested in entering into a CFA, Ms Pegg would send her out the necessary documents.</p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">40.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">In her oral evidence, Mrs Miller said she remembered something having been mentioned about Top Dog, but she did not understand why the solicitors were asking about insurance, and she did not realise that an agreement was needed for them to be paid.

Ms Pegg confirmed that the CFA was only being offered in respect of the claim against Lowcost, but said she would check whether the defendant could assist with the claim for medical negligence.  She did so, but a file note of the same date records that it was considered uneconomic to pursue the medical negligence claim, though there was a hope that any compensation she recovered from the claim against Lowcost would be the same as if she had pursued a medical negligence claim.  In oral evidence, Mrs Miller accepted that she did not now remember this call. Having been able to observe her giving her evidence, I accept that she did not recall it while giving her evidence.  However, her witness statement refers to her remembering it particularly.  I accept that at the time of the statement she did.  In her statement she says that Ms  Pegg said that they did not want to rush things, and that they would not do so in a case which involved only a broken leg, which was when she told her about the amputation. I accept this evidence too though not the sense that Ms Pegg was treating a broken leg as if it did not matter.  From Ms Pegg’s perspective, given that there were ongoing problems, although she did not know about the amputation until she was told, there would have been no particular hurry, subject to limitation.   In her oral evidence Mrs Miller said that both she and Ms Pegg were at fault, and that Ms Pegg had not exactly rushed to look after her. In my judgment that is not a fair assessment: I do not find Ms Pegg to have been at fault since she had made extensive attempts to obtain the documents from Mrs Miller. </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">42.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">Mrs Miller also said in her oral evidence that as far as she was concerned, she was concerned only to make a claim against Lowcost.

As a result of this, he said, it appeared that Mrs Miller’s claim was against an uninsured company now in administration. In fact, it appears that it had gone into administration in July 2016.  Ms Edwards told Mr Banks, of the defendant. His response was to say “let’s proceed as we discussed”, but there is no evidence about that discussion apart from what happened next, which was that Ms Edwards wrote to Mrs Miller following a telephone conversation, to confirm that Lowcost had recently gone into administration and that this was likely to cause a significant issue in terms of the ability to recover any compensation; and that the policy of insurance had been voided due to a failure to notify, which they were checking. (In fact, the policy had not strictly been voided, but had not responded to the claim.).

The ITLG helpline helps the defendant’s ITLG to note enquiries with either a low prospect of success for an immediately obvious reason, or a low value claim for which it would be disproportionate to take the instruction. At the start of each call, the operator would open a new file on the IT platform using the Proforma to which I have already referred which, he said, sets out a number of questions to ask the caller in order to capture the information required to assess whether the call should be transferred to the ITLG. </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">75.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">I find that the Proforma goes considerably further than this, and that many of the questions to which it refers are not and are not intended always to be asked by helpline advisers, but are there to capture information if volunteered and to suggest questions if they seem appropriate to be asked in any particular case. They were not questions which the legal advisor was instructed by the defendant to ask. That is plain from the sheer number of questions or areas for enquiry contained on the Proforma. It would not be practical or sensible in every call to ask all of the questions or explore the areas of enquiry set out on the Proforma which related to the particular circumstances of every potential claim.</p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">76.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">His evidence was that if required, for the purpose of explaining why relevant information was being captured, the operator might provide general legal advice at a very high level. Any such ‘advice’ (to which he referred in inverted commas) was generic, preliminary and pre-retainer as part of the sifting process. The operators did not provide any specific legal advice in relation to the caller’s case, and would not opine on whether it was a good case or not. He did accept, under pressure, that if relevant, the operator might offer high level thoughts for consideration if they thought it was for the benefit of the person calling.  I accept this: it was consistent with the training materials and the evidence of Louise Strutt, to which I refer later; and with the record of the initial call of Mrs Miller. In cross examination he said that advice should not be given unless to help the person calling; but he recognised that whatever generic legal advice any operator would give would be received by the caller, and understood and applied, in the context of their claim.</p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">77.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">The tick list at the end of the Proforma makes it clear, if it was not otherwise clear, that the provision of generic preliminary legal advice contemplated was not just to explain why the questions were being asked.

As counsel for the claimant put it in his oral submissions, the defendant was ‘reeling them in’.</p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">78.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">Mr Lloyd’s evidence was that while the questions asked by the operators were driven by those set out in the Proforma, they might also ask further questions; but they would not ask for specific information, nor details such as whether the caller had notified the tour operator of the incident or ensured that the tour operator had notified its insurers of the incident, though it would not be unusual for a caller to volunteer that information. I do not accept this evidence.   As already noted, but as he appeared to have overlooked, the Proforma itself included a question asking if the caller had notified the tour operator of the incident. The questions on the Proforma about complaints to the tour representative, a complaints form or accident report form, were, he thought, information obtained once referral had been made to a legal team, that is, not information to be obtained or which might be obtained, by the helpline operator. I reject this evidence. The questions were there on the form to be available for use and filled in if used by the operator. There was no evidence to distinguish these questions and any other on the Proforma, and no basis for inferring that they were questions not to be asked by the helpline operator, whether or not the Proforma might also be used by the legal team.

I do not accept this: contrary to his description, it was a very simple document, and I doubt it would have helped an operator much in deciding whether to refer the case.

Hence the (later) language of helpline ‘operators’, and the encouragement on paper at least to give only limited, generic and high-level advice, and only when asked, or at least only when it looked as if it might help. But there was an inevitable tension between minimising that risk and communicating to the caller that, in the defendant, they were dealing with people who cared, and people who would give them valuable legal information (or advice) of relevance to their situation and case. The conclusion is inevitable that the defendant also wanted to do that because it was part of the marketing strategy, and a way of attracting potential clients. That was why the operators worked on a system that allowed them to give legal advice to a limited extent. The system was supposed to balance that tension, but it was an essential part of that system to give the operators themselves very considerable discretion (as the evidence disclosed) about how far to go in any given case.  Partly, no doubt, that was because they were legally qualified, and were the people having the telephone call and were best placed to make the judgment; and partly, perhaps (although this question was not asked or answered) because a degree of indeterminacy helped in balancing the tension to which I have referred. </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">83.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">When asked whether any part of the call involved a disclaimer, he said that there was a recorded part at the beginning of any call, but he did not know what it was at the relevant time.

The advisors were expected to ascertain whether a claim was likely to succeed and was proportionate to pursue, by applying the sifting criteria, assessing the jurisdiction of the limitation position, and applying the allocation process to refer, or to close, cases. Advisors taking the initial enquiries were to provide general legal advice and assess the claim in that way.   Ms Halliwell must have thought Mrs Miller’s case met the criteria and fell within the parameters.  Other helpline advisors were trained to ask, additionally, the usual questions that they would normally be expected to ask when handling a personal injury claim.

The advisors were not trained to say that they were not giving any advice, nor trained to say that the caller could not rely on any advice given on the call. They had ‘safe legal advice’ training before they could give general legal advice. The caller would of course expect it to be relevant to their claim. They were not trained to say that the caller might need to take any urgent steps or seek advice from a different lawyer unless perhaps the operator was closing the case or had been told there were other solicitors.

LTS would have had a local representative. If a customer needed help, they would contact the hotel or LTS in the first instance, and if that did not resolve the issue, would then call the Lowcost in resort assistance telephone number or email. LTS would keep a record and if the incident was serious enough for the tour operator to need involvement, the tour operator might escalate to Mr Mir. This was a value judgment for them to make. It would be relevant whether the incident might have been the fault of the hotel. If LTS thought the event was sufficiently serious and relevant to the hotel, they would send a report to Lowcost which Mr Mir would see, and consider whether Lowcost needed to report to its insurers.  </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">99.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">He did not recall receiving a report about Mrs Miller, and if he had he would have notified Lowcost’s insurers.

It was incidents rather than claims which needed to be notified. HCC would expect a report of the number of incidents in the month, and Lowcost would compile such a report at the end of the month. There might be 5 to 10 incidents per month. If he had not been notified of an incident, for example if the hotel had not reported it to him, but it later came in as a claim, HCC would assess it and if they were not prejudiced and there was an explanation for the delay, they would usually accept the claim. The email dated <span style='background-color:red;'>15 May 2014</span> to Mailbox in Resort would probably have been the inbox for the LTS 24/7 in-resort team. He would expect the in-resort team to have sought a report from the hotel. If the hotel had reported, Mr Mir would have forwarded it on to HCC. If he had learned of an incident and notified HCC, and explained that the hotel had said they would send a report but had not done so, and that he had just found out, and there were photographs of the steps in question, he would not have expected HCC to say that the delay had been a problem in July 2014. If that scenario had occurred in December 2014, HCC would have reserved its position and then there would have been a discussion about the reason for the delay. If the explanation had been accepted, there would then have been a discussion about what prejudice HCC had suffered. If the explanation was that the hotelier had been told to report and had said it would, but had not done so, that would not amount to a good explanation. HCC would expect him or his team to have followed it up, as the incident was relatively serious.

However, the defendant’s advertisement did not amount to an offer to provide legal services.  It was an invitation to the public to call the helpline to see if the defendant could help by providing legal services. It was, at most, an invitation to treat. The question whether the caller would enter into a retainer with the defendant was one for further consideration on both sides, as each will have readily understood. Merely by telephoning, Mrs Miller cannot be regarded as agreeing to enter into a contract with the defendant. Moreover, the supposed offer in the advertisement contained none of the terms which would have been required to govern a contract of retainer. Whether the defendant did or did not decline to act for her during the call, gave her advice, and told her it was passing her case to ITLG, or recorded time charges, is neither here nor there for these purposes, because part of the way in which the claimant put this submission is that the contract was complete when the telephone call was made (or, at least, answered).</p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">105.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text"> The claimant’s case on this included, however, the proposition (presumably as an alternative) that an express retainer was entered into by the end of that telephone call, and on the basis that the defendant did not decline to act for her but gave her advice and told her it was passing her case to ITLG, and started recording time charges.  On that footing, the claimant’s case must be that a bilateral contract of retainer was concluded orally between the parties during the call on <span style='background-color:red;'>19 May 2014</span>.  But again, at no point during the call did anything the defendant said amount to an offer to enter into a retainer, or an assertion that there was one. The record shows that Mrs Miller provided certain information, was advised as to the scope of the Legal Helpline, the law relating to duty, breach and causation in the context of personal injury, and the applicability of the 3 -year limitation period, and that the matter would be referred to ITLG and that she would hear back, which she did.  The defendant did not decline to act for her because her case had passed that stage of the sifting process described by the witnesses, and because there was no question of its acting for her at that stage. Such limited advice as was given to Mrs Miller at that stage was, in my judgment, advice in contemplation of a potential retainer, and not advice referable to one which had come into existence there and then.  Passing the case to the ITLG for someone to get back to Mrs Miller was not an indication that a retainer had been agreed, but that it had not. The fact that time charges had started to be recorded is nothing to the point. No agreement had been made with Mrs Miller that she should be responsible for the defendant’s fees, and I have no doubt that both sides would have been shocked at the suggestion that they had implicitly made one at that point.  At that stage, the fees would not have been Mrs Miller’s responsibility. They might only become her responsibility if a retainer was subsequently entered into on the footing that they would be.</p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">106.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">Another way in which the claimant put its case in argument was that when a retainer was unarguably entered into, upon the creation of the conditional fee agreement, that agreement was retrospective: that is, the parties did not merely agree that fees incurred before that date would now be chargeable, they agreed that (presumably by some form of mutual estoppel) they should be treated as having entered into an express retainer retrospectively as from <span style='background-color:red;'>19 May 2014</span>.

But there is nothing in the conditional fee agreement which either expressly states that it is to have that effect, or from which that consequence must be implied. Even if the conditional fee agreement did involve the parties agreeing that the defendant’s actions or omissions should be judged by standards and criteria applied only retrospectively, there  would still be nothing in it to require the defendant to have taken steps which it should have taken if there had been a retainer, but which it was under no obligation to take if there was not.  It is simply unrealistic to propose that while on or immediately after <span style='background-color:red;'>19 May 2014</span> the defendant was under no obligation to advise Mrs Miller to notify Lowcost or do it themselves (with her authority) but that it later agreed to take on an obligation to have already done something which it had not done.  No doubt contracts may be made which have that effect but, in my view, they would require clear words to that effect, which are lacking in the present case.</p>          </div></section>        <section>            <p><u>Implied retainer</u></p>          </section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">108.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">I turn, therefore, to the claimant’s case that if there was not an express retainer on <span style='background-color:red;'>19 May 2014</span>, one should be implied.  <span style="color:#000000">The editors of Jackson &amp; Powell on </span><i><span style="color:#000000">Professional Liability</span></i><span style="color:#000000"> (8th ed.) state as follows (at 11-005): </span></p>          <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div>              <p class="judgment-body__text">“In a situation where the parties act as if the relationship of solicitor and client existed, although there is no express agreement to that effect, the court will readily hold that there is an implied retainer to be inferred from the parties’ conduct.” </p>            </div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div>              <p class="judgment-body__text">And in <i>Caliendo v Mishcon De Reya</i> [2016] EWHC 150 (Ch) Arnold J. stated as follows (at para 679): </p>            <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div>                <p class="judgment-body__text">“It is well established, that even if there has been no express retainer, the existence of a retainer may be inferred from the acts of the parties.

It is true that the defendant referred to Mrs Miller from this point onwards as its client; but it did so internally, and did not describe her as its client to her.  Certainly, it opened a file in respect of her enquiry, but again that was an internal matter, and was not communicated to her, and in my judgment would hardly have suggested to any reasonable person in her position that it was a file which related to her as any more than a potential client of the defendant. For the defendant’s own purposes, of course, that is exactly why it needed the file. The defendant recorded time charges against that file, but not on the footing that she was already liable for fees, merely that she might at some time become so.  Again, she was wholly unaware of it at the time.  Had she been asked (and she was not) I very much doubt she would have agreed to be responsible for the defendant’s fees at that point.  The defendant’s system was set up and structured so as to attract enquiries which, after a sifting process, might be converted into a retainer, but only after consideration by ITLG and following the provision by the prospective client of the necessary information and documents.  None of that had occurred on or shortly after <span style='background-color:red;'>19 May 2014</span>. Indeed, on <span style='background-color:red;'>20 May 2014</span> the defendant wrote and asked for documentation saying explicitly that once it had been reviewed, the writer would contact Mrs Miller to discuss whether the defendant was able to accept her case. There was nothing ambiguous about that, and it made it clear that the question whether the defendant was accepting her case remained an open one.  In cross-examination, Mrs Miller said that on the basis of this letter she knew that when Darren sent the defendant the documents which they had asked for, the defendant was taking her case. I accept that she may have thought that, but that is not what the letter said.</p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">110.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">On or about <span style='background-color:red;'>8 April 2015</span>, the defendant finally received and then reviewed Mrs Miller’s accommodation details and invoice for her holiday, following numerous chasing letters <span style="color:#000000">(<span style='background-color:red;'>7 July 2014</span>, <span style='background-color:red;'>22 July 2014</span>, <span style='background-color:red;'>15 August 2014</span>, <span style='background-color:red;'>3 October 2014</span>, <span style='background-color:red;'>2 January 2015</span> and <span style='background-color:red;'>28 January 2015</span>), two of which expressly warned her: </span></p>          <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div>              <p class="judgment-body__text">“You must be aware that no action has been taken by my firm to establish what limitation period would apply to your claim or to protect your right to take any legal action in any jurisdiction”. </p>            </div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div>              <p class="judgment-body__text">Those warnings did not explicitly say, “We are not acting for you” or “We have not yet taken on your case”.

Nor can the mere fact that she was receiving chasing letters have provided her with any such comfort.  The conduct of the defendant is consistent (and in my view actually consistent only) with the defendant’s seeking information with a view to deciding thereafter whether or not to offer to enter into a retainer with Mrs Miller.

I agree that it must have done so then at the latest.  In the period since <span style='background-color:red;'>8 April 2015</span> the defendant had undertaken a number of activities in relation to Mrs Miller’s potential claim.  In May and June 2015, it obtained from the internet Lowcost’s terms and conditions, reviewed them, and sought and obtained counsel’s (free) advice on them.  It did not seek Mrs Miller’s authority to do so; but as the defendant explained to counsel, it had not yet established funding on the matter, and wanted the advice “so we can decide whether we are able to accept the claim”. The purpose of the advice was to determine the basis of any potential claim. That was something in which the defendant had at least as much interest as Mrs Miller, since it was still seeking to determine whether her claim was one which it was prepared to offer to take on as her solicitor. It did not tell her about that advice until September 2015.  </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">112.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">In June and July 2015, the defendant had asked for and obtained Mrs Miller’s travel insurance documents. As it made clear, that was so as to consider how any claim might be funded. Although Mrs Miller said, in effect, that she had not been concerned with how the claim might be funded, the defendant had communicated to her that it was a matter which needed to be resolved before the defendant took on her claim.  The defendant would hardly have done so without being confident of funding.  </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">113.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">On <span style='background-color:red;'>21 September 2015</span> the defendant wrote to Mrs Miller asking if there was any other legal expenses insurance and saying that if not it would be happy to offer her a conditional fee agreement.  The letter asked about the steps: whether there was a handrail, and whether she had any photographs taken at a greater distance showing the surroundings.  Even at this stage, I do not consider that the claimant and the defendant were acting in a way which was only consistent with the defendant having been retained as Mrs Miller’s solicitors.  Funding had still not been resolved. There was no agreement about fees or payment terms. Mrs Miller asked if the defendant could also assist with a clinical negligence claim so, from her perspective at least, the ambit of any potential instructions had not yet been established. None of this is consistent only with the parties having entered into a retainer at that stage.  That did not happen, as the defendant accepts, until <span style='background-color:red;'>25 January 2016</span>, when the defendant told her that it was ready to proceed with her claim, the next step being the completion of the CFA.</p>          </div></section>        <section>            <p><u>A tortious duty of care</u></p>          </section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">114.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">I turn, therefore, to the question whether, in the absence of an express or implied contractual retainer, the defendant owed Mrs Miller an equivalent duty of care in tort at any stage before <span style='background-color:red;'>25 January 2016</span>. </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">115.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">On the basis of, for example, <i>Crossan v Ward Bracewell &amp; Co</i> (1989) 4 P.N. 103 the claimant submits that a duty of care is owed by a solicitor to a prospective client to whom the solicitor gives advice, even if that person is not and never becomes a client of the solicitor. The claimant further submits that even more so, a duty of care will be owed by a solicitor to a prospective client to whom the solicitor gives advice who does actually later become a client of the solicitor. I can deal with that second proposition immediately.  It does not make any difference to the existence of a tortious duty of care to a prospective client whether that client later becomes a client of that solicitor. The duty to the merely prospective client either exists at the time or it does not.  Later events cannot affect that (absent, perhaps, the kind of mutual estoppel to which I have already referred, which is nothing to the point in the present context). </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">116.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">I turn therefore to the first proposition.  In submissions, counsel for the claimant made it clear that although there might be two tests for establishing a relevant tortious duty of care, namely the incremental approach and the assumption of responsibility principle, this was not a case where established present principles do not provide an answer, so that use of the incremental approach was not required.</p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">117.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">The assumption of responsibility principle applies where the parties are in a relationship which gives rise to a responsibility towards those who act upon information or advice and so creates a duty of care towards them. One of the examples of the types of general relationship giving rise to such a duty given by Lord Devlin in <i>Hedley Byrne v Heller</i> [1964] AC 465 was the relationship of solicitor and client.  The ratio of that decision was that the reasonable reliance of Hedley Byrne on the reference, combined with Heller &amp; Partners’ appreciation of the fact that they would reasonably rely on it, give rise to a direct relationship between them involving a duty of care: <i>Playboy Club London Ltd v Banco Nazionale del Lavoro SpA </i>[2018] UKSC 43.  The <i>Playboy </i>case is authority for the proposition that recovery of a purely economic loss in negligence is available where the relationship between the claimant and the defendant made it appropriate; but where there was reasonable reliance by the claimant on the particular representation combined with appreciation by the defendant of that reliance, a direct relationship arose between them involving a duty of care; but it was the responsibility, voluntarily accepted by the defendant, towards those who acted on the representation, based either on a general relationship, or specifically in relation to a particular transaction, which created such a duty.  That approach extends to claims in professional negligence.</p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">118.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">The reference to a voluntary assumption of responsibility must not, however, be taken to mean that the defendant professional needs to consent to the claimant placing responsibility upon him.  Rather it refers to a situation where the doing of that act implies a voluntary undertaking to assume responsibility. Accordingly, in a given case it is the task of the court to consider all the facts and to assess whether they give rise to an implication that the defendant has voluntarily assumed responsibility to the claimant.  In <i>P&amp;P Property Ltd v Owen White &amp; Catlin LLP</i> [2018] 3 WLR 1244 Patten LJ stated at paragraph 76 </p>          <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div>              <p class="judgment-body__text">“… The requirement that there should be an assumption of responsibility is to some extent a legal construct in the sense that in many cases the defendant solicitor or other professional will be treated as having assumed responsibility to the third party for his actions by virtue of the proximity between them and the obvious effect which any failure on his part would have on the third party. There will rarely be an actual, conscious and voluntary assumption of responsibility not least because the solicitor or other professional will have a client to whom he is contractually bound. But, on the basis that the court is deciding whether to treat the defendant as having assumed legal responsibility to the third party, non-client, or his actions, it will be necessary to balance the foreseeability that the third party will rely on the professional to perform their task in a competent manner against any other factors which would make such an imposition of liability unreasonable or unfair.”</p>            </div></section></div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">119.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">The claimant submitted that in the present case, apart from the question of the retainer, the critical question was whether there was the relevant relationship. I agree.  The claimant submitted that there was, because Mrs Miller had sought and received advice, and the defendant was treating her as a client by giving a file reference, with a supervising partner, referring to her as a client, giving her advice as a client, obtaining Counsel’s advice, updating her as a client and so on, and logging fees as work in progress. </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">120.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">I do not accept this.  The true nature of the relationship until was that Mrs Miller was only a potential client of the defendant until <span style='background-color:red;'>25 January 2016</span> and no duty of care equivalent to that under a retainer was owed to her until then.  </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">121.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">The facts upon which the claimant particularly relies do not actually support her case.  I do not accept that the defendant held itself out (via its TV advertisement) as ready, willing and able to assist persons in the position of the claimant: ready and able in principle, yes; but its willingness depended on a sifting process and the creation of a retainer, and its advertisement did not say otherwise.  The limited basis on which the helpline worked was explained to Mrs Miller, as I find.  During her conversation with the claimant on <span style='background-color:red;'>19 May 2014</span>, Ms Halliwell gave Mrs Miller some limited high-level and generic legal advice about personal injury claims, but it did not purport and cannot have been understood to be complete or comprehensive legal advice about her claim, and it was a preliminary to further consideration.  The question of obtaining separate legal advice did not arise for the reasons I have already given.  The fact that during her conversation with Ms Halliwell, Mrs Miller was told that her case was being referred to the defendant’s ITLG counts against there being a general duty in tort equivalent to the solicitor’s duty of care to his client, rather in favour of it.  The defendant’s having a file and matter number for Mrs Miller’s potential claim, recording time charges, and referring to her internally as its client is immaterial for the reasons I have already given.  The fact that the defendant did not want or advise Mrs Miller to seek advice is also immaterial.  The relationship between them was not akin to a contractual relationship.   Mrs Miller was certainly entitled to rely on such advice as she was given, but she was not advised to ensure the insurers were informed, and the facts to which I have referred did not give rise to a duty on the defendant to provide such advice. Her undoubted lack of experience in legal matters does not change that.  </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">122.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text"><i>Crossan v Ward Bracewell &amp; Co</i> (1989) 4 P.N. 103 is to be distinguished.

But if he finds unusual covenants or planning restrictions, it may indeed be his duty to warn of the risks and dangers of buying the house at all, notwithstanding that the client is made up his mind and is not seeking advice about that. I say only that this <i>may</i> be his duty, because the precise scope of that duty will depend <i>inter alia</i> upon the extent to which the client appears to need advice.

The plaintiff defended himself and never instructed the solicitors. The solicitor had, however, failed to tell him that his insurance company would arrange and pay for his legal representation, and since the plaintiff failed to tell his insurers of the proceedings, they repudiated liability; and he had also to meet a third party claim out of his own pocket.

That was a case in which, when solicitors received instructions to act in relation to a notice pursuant to section 25 Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 to terminate a lease, and they were well aware of the applicable time limit, it was held that they were under a duty either to indicate that they were not going to act, or to take immediate steps to ensure that their tenant client’s interests were safeguarded. In the present case, there was no time limit.  But  <i>Whelton Sinclair v Hyland </i>was a case in which the preservation of the tenancy was the central focus of the solicitors’ instructions.  They were not instructed in relation to potential litigation, and what needed to be done was the service of a counter-notice rather than the commencement of a claim.  In the present case, the question is the ambit of instructions to act for a client in a contentious matter.  </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">136.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">Had there been a retainer or a like duty, I should have been inclined to hold that in a contentious claim it included the obligation, at least with an inexperienced client, to consider, or remind the client to consider, whether the proposed defendant was worth powder and shot; and that this might include an obligation at least when notifying the proposed defendant of the potential claim to remind them to notify their insurer. A judgment which cannot be enforced is not worth the expense of pursuit. Prospective defendants, like any other companies, can and do go into liquidation or administration; or their assets may in any event be insufficient to meet the claim without insurance. There was no particular reason to suppose that Lowcost was at any greater risk than any other company of its kind, but equally no particular reason to suppose that it was not at any lower risk. Moreover, I think it unlikely that the Pre-action Protocol for Personal Injury Claims in 2021 represents a new best practice, rather than reflection of an existing standard practice.  I am reinforced in this by the fact that as soon as the letter of claim was sent in the present case, the enquiry about insurance was made. But I do not consider that the duty to make such an enquiry arose before the point at which it was reasonably possible to send a letter of claim or, at the earliest, a prior letter of notification, though any letter of notification would not have been much earlier in the present case, so that here the time for performance of that duty was not, or not significantly, before the letter of claim was actually sent.  Until there was a retainer or like duty, I conclude on the authorities and on the facts of this case that there was no duty to warn in respect of insurance. </p>          </div></section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text"><b><u>iii)</u></b><span> </span><b><u>If such a retainer was formed or like duty assumed, whether the defendant had an obligation to take steps to notify Lowcost and/or advise the claimant to notify Lowcost of the claimant’s accident</u></b></p>          <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">a)</span><div>              <p class="judgment-body__text"><b><u>during the initial call between the claimant and the defendant on <span style='background-color:red;'>19 May 2014</span>; or</u></b></p>            </div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">b)</span><div>              <p class="judgment-body__text"><b><u>on or before <span style='background-color:red;'>8 April 2015</span> when the defendant received the claimant’s documents, and if so when; or</u></b></p>            </div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">c)</span><div>              <p class="judgment-body__text"><b><u>before the letter of claim was served on <span style='background-color:red;'>22 February 2016</span>; and if so, when.</u></b></p>            </div></section></div></section>        <section>            <p><u>Conclusion </u></p>          </section>        <section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">137.</span><div>            <p class="judgment-body__text">I have answered this question in the discussion on the scope of the duty.

The Privy Council held that any award of damages against the solicitors should be made on the accepted basis of the loss of chance of recovery. In reckoning the chances of obtaining payment from the insurer, the correct criterion was to determine the prospects that a reputable insurer would, in the circumstances of the case, have relied on the breach of policy to repudiate liability. The nature of the breach and its effect on the insurer’s ability to handle a claim, were very relevant features. In considering such chances a court should lean, in the event of doubt, in favour of the claimant, since it was the defendant solicitor’s fault which caused the claimant have to litigate on the basis of an imponderable.

The question whether the insurer would have rejected a claim for late notification was one of fact. In that case, the clause was a clear and unequivocal condition precedent regarding early notification, which was a matter of obvious importance to liability insurers’ ability to investigate and assess any claim.

Mr Mir’s evidence, based on his experience, was that HCC expected to be notified within one month and if there had been a delay of more than two or three months, there would have to be a conversation.  I accept this.  He said that if there was a good reason for the delay, there would then have to be a conversation about prejudice; but if there was not a good reason, liability would be repudiated.  On this point, however, I prefer the evidence of the defendant’s insurance expert, Mr McGregor, as being based on wider experience.  His written evidence was that in his experience insurers only consider immediate notice has not been given if the position has been prejudiced by that lack of immediate notice.  There is, as I say, no evidence from HCC on prejudice, but after 11 months, it seems highly likely, as a matter of common sense, that the ability of HCC to investigate the incident was substantially prejudiced, quite apart from the question of late notification.  Although there might be photographs of the stairs in question at the date of the accident, and perhaps maintenance records, witnesses might have moved on, and their recollection would be likely in any event to have been compromised.

Any claims where the total of damages and costs payable fell below £10,000 fell to be met entirely by Lowcost and did not count towards the aggregate access. Only payments over £10,000 would have become part of the aggregate excess of £560,000, and then only to the extent that the claim exceeded the initial retention of £10,000. Only once that aggregate excess of £560,000 was used would the insurer become liable to indemnify against any claim.  The evidence before me shows that only £6765.78 of the aggregate had been eroded for the 2013/2014 policy year: that appears from the letter from Tokio Marine HCC, the successor to HCC.  The way in which this figure is calculated has been provided by the insurers in a spreadsheet.

I accept of course that this case referred to different provisions, and in a different commercial context but there, as here, the words appeared clear, and there seems to be no room for equity to overcome them.  The decision in <i>The Italia Express</i> [1992] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 281 appears to have been directed to a different point, namely the incorporation of the ‘pay to be paid’ provision in the relevant part of an insurance contract.  No such issue arises in the present case. In <i>Teal Assurance Co Ltd v W R Berkely Insurance (Europe) Ltd</i> [2013] UKSC 57 it was held that in the circumstances of that case it was not clear that ‘paid’ meant ‘actually disbursed’; but nor was it clear what actually would have to be disbursed if it did.

I am unable to accept that proposition.  The point was taken in <i>Firma C-Trade SA v Newcastle P &amp; I Association </i>and rejected, on the ground that if the insured could not discharge its liability to a third party and was therefore unable to obtain an indemnity from his P &amp; I club in respect of it, that was not because of any alteration of his rights and his contract of insurance, but because of his inability, by reason of insolvency, to exercise those rights.
